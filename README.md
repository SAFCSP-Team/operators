# Operators

### Objective

Understand and apply basic operators in Java.

### Problem

Use arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators on the provided input.

### Implementation

- Create two integer variables: `a = 10` and `b = 3`.
- Print the sum, difference, and product of `a` and `b`.
- Use the assignment operator to add `5` to `a` and print the result.
- Compare if `a` is greater than `b` and print the result.
- Use logical operators to check if `a` is greater than `5` and `b` is less than `5`, then print the result.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* add your code here */
    }
}
```
